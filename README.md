# Solutions for the take home for Unlisted

Thanks for taking the time to review my solution for the take home challenge! :)

## Q1

- The question seemed pretty clear and straight forward. Did not have any clarifying questions.
- This might reflect poorly, but I couldn't think of any changes that I could make that would optimize the run time complexity of my original solution.

## Q2

- Didn't really find the need to use data structures to solve this problem. Just used 2 regular expressions to find the number of openings and closing parenthesis. Took the difference of these two values to figure out how many closing parenthesis needed to be appended to the end of each sentence.
